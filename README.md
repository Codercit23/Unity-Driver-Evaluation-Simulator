# 🚗 Unity-Based Driver Evaluation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Driver Evaluation System developed using the Unity Engine** to assess driving behavior in a simulated environment.  
It is designed for **driving schools, simulators, research, and smart mobility evaluation**.

The system monitors driver actions in real time and generates an objective performance score.
