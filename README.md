# 🚗 Unity-Based Driver Evaluation System with ADAS Integration

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **intelligent driving simulator built using the Unity Engine** that combines **driver performance evaluation** with **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.

The simulator recreates real-world driving scenarios to **monitor driver behavior in real time**, **evaluate driving skills**, and **demonstrate ADAS features** commonly used in modern vehicles.  
It is designed for **training, research, safety analysis, and competition-based evaluation**.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities
- Real-time driver behavior analysis
- Objective driver performance scoring
- ADAS feature simulation and validation
- Scenario-based driving tests
- Traffic rule compliance monitoring

---

## 🚘 Implemented ADAS Features
- **Lane Departure Warning (LDW)**
- **Forward Collision Warning (FCW)**
- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC – simulated)**
- **Speed Limit Warning**
- **Emergency Braking Assistance (logic-based)**
- **Driver Reaction Time Analysis**

---

## 🎯 Driver Evaluation Parameters
- Speed compliance
- Lane discipline
- Collision events
- Sudden acceleration / braking
- Traffic signal violations
- ADAS response effectiveness

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Physics & Sensors:** Unity Physics, Raycasting
- **ADAS Logic:** Rule-based & threshold-based algorithms
- **Input Devices:** Keyboard / Logitech G29 Steering Wheel with pedals
- **Platform:** Windows

---

## 📊 Scoring & Decision Logic
The system uses a **penalty-based weighted scoring model**, where:
- Unsafe driving actions reduce the score
- ADAS interventions are logged and evaluated
- Safer driving behavior results in higher performance ratings

---

## 🧪 Simulation Scenarios
- Urban traffic environments
- Highway driving
- Obstacle and pedestrian detection
- Sudden braking scenarios
- Lane deviation cases
